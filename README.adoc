= Shell scripts

This repository is just an archive if random shell scripts that I've written
over the years. They're not meant to be used as-is. Rather, they serve as a
reference for how to do certain things in shell scripts.

Most of the scripts are written in Bash (`#!/bin/bash`) but some are POSIX
compliant (`#!/bin/sh`). These scripts are typically used for provisioning
and configuring Debian-based servers, and for performing system administration
tasks.
